ADDED BY WOLF:

So How do I compile this?
===
Go check out the original ja++ website, you can follow the compilation instructions there.
My compilation method may be a bit different from Raz0r's but it should work.


What if it wont still compile?
===
You can contact me on the JKCommunity Discord or over Steam

===
AutoHotkey. Go google it up, you won't regret it.
